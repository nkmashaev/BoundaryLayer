# Boundary Layer Problem

## Goal

The goal is to calculate a boundary layer over a flat plate.

## Content

1. **shimuni** - solving of boundary layer problem by shimuni method
1. **navier-stokes** - solving of boundary layer problem by solving the
Navier-Stokes system

## Prerequisites

Programs are tested on Ubuntu 20.04. GNU Fortran 9.3.0 are used.

## Result

The outcome is a computed field with distribution of skin
friction coefficient over the plate
